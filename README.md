## Process

* Started off with declaring what we want to achieve by stating the useStates e.g. username, pending screen, repos etc.

* Defined functions when submitting usernames on the form

* useEffect to show the repos and repo details

* Each time you click on the search button you will see  render rows which will present the results

* Created another component which represents the repo details, this includes the name, date created, updated, how many forks, stargazers and watchers as well as languages used.


## Wins & Challenges

### Wins

* Able to make fetch requests
* Able to view everyone's repos in real time
* Able to view the statistics for each repo e.g watchers, stars and forks
* Able to remove repos once changing other people's usernames for security reasons
* Styling

### Challenges // Future Features

* Unable to capture ALL of the languages (some repos use more than 1 language, we are only able to see the language with the biggest %)

* Fetch how many repos each username has
